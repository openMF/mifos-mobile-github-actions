## Overview
#
# This reusable GitHub Actions workflow provides a comprehensive Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline
# for multi-platform mobile and desktop applications, specifically designed for projects using Gradle and Java/Kotlin.
#
### Key Features
# - Automated code quality checks
# - Dependency management and verification
# - Cross-platform desktop application builds (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
# - Android APK build generation
# - Artifact generation and storage
#
### Workflow Jobs
# 1. **Setup**: Prepares the build environment
#   - Checks out repository code
#   - Sets up Java 17
#   - Configures Gradle
#   - Manages dependency caching
#
# 2. **Code Quality Checks**:
#   - Build logic verification
#   - Code formatting checks (Spotless)
#   - Static code analysis (Detekt)
#
# 3. **Dependency Guard**:
#   - Verifies dependencies against baseline
#   - Prevents unauthorized dependency changes
#   - Supports automatic baseline updates
#
# 4. **Android App Build**:
#   - Builds debug APK for demo flavor
#   - Uploads APK artifacts
#
### Prerequisites
#   - Java 17
#   - Gradle
#   - Configured build scripts for:
#       - Android module
#       - Desktop module
#   - Installed Gradle plugins:
#       - Spotless
#       - Detekt
#       - Dependency Guard
#
### Configuration Parameters
# The workflow requires two input parameters:
#
#   | Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
#   |-----------|-------------|------|----------|
#   | `android_package_name` | Name of the Android project module | String | Yes |
#
### Usage Example
#   ```yaml
# name: PR Checks
# Trigger conditions for the workflow
#  on:
#    push:
#      branches: [ dev ]  # Runs on pushes to dev branch
#    pull_request:       # Runs on all pull requests
#
#  # Concurrency settings to prevent multiple simultaneous workflow runs
#  concurrency:
#    group: pr-${{ github.ref }}
#    cancel-in-progress: true  # Cancels previous runs if a new one is triggered
#
#  permissions:
#    contents: write
