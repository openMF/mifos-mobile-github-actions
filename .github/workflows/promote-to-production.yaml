# GitHub Actions Workflow for Play Store Release Promotion
#
# PURPOSE:
# This workflow automates the process of promoting a beta release
# to the production track on Google Play Store.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
# 1. Fastlane setup with Android deployment configurations
# 2. Configured Fastlane lanes:
#    - `promote_to_production`: Handles beta to production promotion
#
# REQUIRED CONFIGURATION:
# - Secrets:
#   playstore_creds: Google Play Store service account JSON credentials
#
# INPUTS:
# - android_package_name: Name of the Android project module
#   (REQUIRED, must match your project's module structure)
#
# WORKFLOW TRIGGERS:
# - Can be called manually or triggered by other workflows
# - Typically used after beta testing and validation
#
# DEPLOYMENT PROCESS:
# 1. Checks out repository code
# 2. Sets up Ruby and Fastlane environment
# 3. Inflates Play Store credentials
# 4. Runs Fastlane lane to promote beta to production
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Requires proper Fastlane configuration in your project
# - Ensures consistent and automated Play Store deployments
# - Configurable retry mechanism for upload stability
#
# RECOMMENDED FASTLANE LANE IMPLEMENTATION:
# ```ruby
# lane :promote_to_production do
#   upload_to_play_store(
#     track: 'beta',
#     track_promote_to: 'production',
#     json_key: './playStorePublishServiceCredentialsFile.json'
#   )
# end
# ```
